# Local-Messaging-App
This short project focuses on TCP sockets and learning about their capabilities. As a fun experiment to learn more about them I developed a multithreaded server that made use of a wide variety of concepts such as the readers-writers problem. It also ended up being the project that inspired me to create the much more sophisticatd ST messaging app using AWS, which can be seen in the similarly named repository on my github profile.

Languages and Frameworks: Python, TCP/IP, Mutex/Semaphore, Multi-threading
